  abstract = {This book is a modern introduction to the ideas and techniques of quantum
field theory. After a brief overview of particle physics and a survey of
relativistic wave equations and Lagrangian methods, the author develops the
quantum theory of scalar and spinor fields, and then of gauge fields. The
emphasis throughout is on functional methods, which have played a large part
in modern field theory. The book concludes with a brief survey of
"topological" objects in field theory and, new to this edition, a chapter
devoted to supersymmetry. Graduate students in particle physics and high
energy physics will benefit from this book.},
